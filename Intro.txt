  -> Make it easy to make reusable "view components".
    * These "encapsulate" logic and HTML into a class.
  -> Often make it easier to build modular applications.


Components:-
   1.The building blocks of React.
   2.Pieces of UI & View Logic.
   3.Classes that know how to render themselves into HTML.
